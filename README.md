Hyrule Map
===================

Overview
-------
This repo shows a map of Hyrule in *The Legend Of Zelda : Breath Of The Wild* written in Javascript and JQuery. It can be moved with the mouse, and zoomed with the wheel. The resolution can increase or decrease with the zoom factor. 

You can use this map system with any other map images : you just have to replace the provided images (img folder) and adapt the `img` object to fit the tiles dimensions. 

Strike `D`to toggle debug mode, which enables console logging and tiles separation for a better visualisation of the resolution adaptation.
